EBOSS Api PHP Wrapper
==================


Introduction
------------
This is a PHP wrapper class for the [EBOSS REST API](https://github.com/eboss-api/api-docs). Please refer to this link for any additional information about the underlying API methods.
It wraps the methods exposed via the REST API into php methods, takes care of caching and returns PHP objects, ready to render in your application. 

This allows suppliers who store their brand and product data with EBOSS to access and reuse this information for PHP website integration.


Access
------
Please [contact EBOSS](http://www.eboss.co.nz/contact) if you are an EBOSS supplier and would like access to the API.

Once approved EBOSS will supply you with an api username, api key, and brand id number.


Requirements
------------
PHP 5.2+
PHP-CURL extension

Available Methods
-----------------
Every API method returns an EbossAPIClient_Response object which represents the data requested. Variables can be directly called using the object's methods i.e. $response->Title, or alternatively debugged via the Data() method i.e. $response->Data().

**EbossAPIClient::Brand(int $brand_id)**

Returns information for $brand_id.


**EbossAPIClient::Categories(int $brand_id)**

Returns categories for $brand_id.


**EbossAPIClient::Category(int $brand_id , int $category_id)**

Returns category information for $brand_id and $category_id.


**EbossAPIClient::Ranges(int $brand_id)**

Returns ranges for $brand_id.


**EbossAPIClient::Range(int $brand_id , int $range_id)**

Returns range info for $brand_id and $range_id.


**EbossAPIClient::Products(int $brand_id [, array $filter])**

Returns products for $brand_id, filtered by $filter.

$filter should be an array with the following, optional key=>value pairs:

*CategoryID => $category_id*  - which returns all products within a category.

*RangeID => $range_id* - which returns all products within a range.


**EbossAPIClient::Product(int $brand_id , int $product_id)**

Returns the full list of all product information available for given $product_id within $brand_id scope.
